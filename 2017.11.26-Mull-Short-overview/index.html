# Mull: short overview

---

## Who is Stanislav?

- iOS developer by day, 7 years of experience in software development
- 1.5 years of programming for LLVM in a spare time
- Interests: developer tools, software verification, LLVM
- http://stanislaw.github.io/
- https://systemundertest.org/
- https://github.com/mull-project/mull

---

## What is Mull?

- Mutation testing system based on top of LLVM

- Potentially can work with any programming language that compiles to LLVM IR

- Already implemented:
  - C/C++
  - Rust (on hold, we know it works)

- Pending:
  - Objective-C
  - Swift

---

## Mutation Testing: raw algorithm

```c
run_test(program, test);
mutant = mutate(program);
result = run_test(mutant, test)
if (result == Failed) {
  report_killed_mutant(mutant, test);
} else {
  report_survived_mutant(mutant, test);
}
```

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Killed mutant</span> means our
test is good: it is able to detect a change in a code.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; ">Survived mutant</span> means our
test is not able to detect a change in a code: we either need to improve
existing test or write more tests to kill survived mutants.

`assert(sum(10, 5) > 0)` is the example of a shallow test: mutation `+ -> -`
will survive. To kill the mutants we just need to make it
`assert(sum(10, 5) == 15);`

## How to make Mull support a programming language?

- Language must be LLVM-friendly
  - Should support compilation to LLVM IR: `*.bc` and `*.ll`

- Find tests
  - Each programming language has its own implementation details.
  - Algorithm depends on a test framework used: Google Test, XCTest,
  Rust's native test framework etc.

- Find testees (code that is tested), find mutation points in them

- Make tests run with LLVM JIT

---

## How to run Mull on a project

- Step 1: Building Mull
- Step 2: Getting LLVM bitcode
- Step 3: Creating config.yml file
- Step 4: Running Mull
- Step 5: Generating HTML report

---

## Mutation Testing Coverage and Code Coverage

- Statement coverage < mutation testing coverage
- Branch coverage <= mutation testing coverage
  - Negate condition mutation operator: `true <-> false`
- Condition coverage <= mutation testing coverage
  - Negate condition mutation operator: `true <-> false`
  - AND-OR mutation operator: `&& <-> ||`
- MC/DC coverage > mutation testing coverage
  - Tried NASA tutorial: Mull gives 100% coverage on examples that do not
satisfy MC/DC.
- Mutation testing is not the best coverage but it is much better than
statement coverage. We see it as a good replacement for statement coverage to
raise the standards of testing.

---

## Mutation Testing and Symbolic Execution

- Symbolic execution is an extremely friendly technique
- KLEE is a tool for symbolic execution, also LLVM-based
- KLEE can generate tests automatically
- "Mull and Klee, part 1: mutation testing analysis for Klee's Tutorial Two"
  - Compared Mull and KLEE on a simple C function. KLEE generated tests with
  maximum of 87% mutation coverage.
  - Test-generation very much depends on a solver KLEE uses.
  - Needs a human to analyze the results.
  - KLEE cannot generate tests easily readable by human (we reported this:
  https://github.com/klee/klee/issues/648)

## Mull 2016-2017: brief history

- Proof of concept: running `a + b` then `a - b` using LLVM JIT
- Running tests in a fork'ed process
- Reverse engineering Google Test to run it with LLVM JIT
- C++ support
- Implementation of math: add, sub, mul, div, scalar value, replace call,
remove void call, negate condition, AND-OR
- HTML reporting
- Initial Rust support
- Getting to work on Linux Ubuntu and CentOS
- From static test finder to dynamic test finder: find mutations in function
pointers and polymorphic classes
- IDE diagnostics
- Analysis of LLVM ADT and Support, fmt, OpenSSL, newlibm/libm libraries

## Further work

### High-level goals

- Make Mull a general purpose tool for mutation testing.

### Implementation

- Much better visual reporting.
- Integration to IDEs.
- Support of Swift / Objective-C
- 1-click integration of Mull into C++/CMake-based projects.

### Research

- Auto-generation of tests
  - KLEE and libFuzzer can help

<!-- ## Perception by community

- People vaguely understand what mutation testing is and how they can benefits
from it. We see that the same happens to testing, TDD, normal code coverage so
that's fine.
- People expect something easy-to-use.

 -->

## Open questions

These are the questions we want to answer with Mull eventually.

- Can mutation testing actually detect serious errors in the real-world programs?
- What are the most effective mutation operators?
- Compare mutation testing with other methods like static analysis, fuzz
testing, etc.
- Can mutation testing help to find errors that a normal testing with a code
coverage cannot find?
- Can mutation testing help in automatic test generation?
